        "A significant challenge in quantum computing is the efficient encoding of classical data into quantum states that can be processed by quantum hardware or simulated on classical computers. This is particularly crucial for many financial applications, where the first step of a quantum algorithm often involves efficiently loading a probability distribution. For instance, to enable lenders to price loans more accurately based on each borrower's unique risk profile, it is essential to estimate individual loan risk distributions (such as default and prepayment) while accounting for uncertainties in modeling and macroeconomic factors. Efficiently implementing this process on a quantum computer requires the ability to load a log-normal or other complex distribution into a quantum state [(Breeden and Leonova)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01605682.2022.2115415).\n",

        "\n",
        "This tutorial explores how to load a probability distribution with a given property (in this case, a fixed mean) into a quantum state. By following this example, you will gain the essential knowledge needed to comprehend more sophisticated algorithms, such as the multi-split-step quantum walks (mSSQW) method, as described by  [Chang et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12500) The mSSQW technique can be employed to load a log-normal distribution, which is useful for modeling the spot price of a financial asset at maturity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pedagogical Remark:** The reason why we chose to examine the courser problem of generating a distribution with a targeted mean as opposed to generating a targeted distribution iteself (as in [Chang et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12500)) is that by considering the mean of the distribution we can introduce the concept of expectation value of a Hamiltonian which is central to many variational algorithm applications in chemistry, optimization, and machine learning.  \n",

        "\n",
        "Up to this point, for this step of the quantum program, we utilized `cudaq.get_state` and `cudaq.sample` to read out a statevector from the quantum kernel. However, this approach is not always practical, especially considering that the dimension of the statevector scales exponentially with the number of qubits. For example, describing the statevector for $100$ qubits would require storing $2^{100}$ amplitudes, which is extremely memory-intensive. In many quantum algorithms, we do not need a complete description of the statevector; instead, partial information like an \"average\" value often suffices.  This is where the concept of expectation value comes in.\n",

        "2. **Targeted Distribution Generation**: Adapt the variational algorithm to generate a targeted distribution. To do this, you will need to sample the distribution at each stage and use the mean square error between the sampled distribution and the targeted distribution as your cost function. Hint: For this problem, you will use the `sample` command instead of the `observe` command and you will not need to define a Hamiltonian.\n",
